* TODO Initialising the pipeline

Probably best to do this by copying code from the =igad_paper_pipeline=, the =conda= version.

- [ ] delete redundant =smk= files
- [ ] delete redundant =conda= environments
- [X] set R package with code for meta-analysis etc.
- [ ] use EBISPOT pipeline? Seems more defensible than rolling my own


* TODO estimating sdY in all data sets
* TODO Z-score plots
